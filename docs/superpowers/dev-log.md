# Development Log

## 2026-08-17 — Phase 1 (Foundation) complete

- Backend: standalone Apps Script project, deployed as a Web App
  (`https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbySk37loMP-Go23y-bTZBeSlsY1Kop96tKg476U16YFlNKYxXAsh0IzmeKMDCrrq6TI/exec`). 25-tab Sheet schema created in the real production Sheet.
  Drive folder structure created under "HPU Inter College Kabaddi Tournament 2026".
  SETTINGS seeded with defaults (rates, blank meal timings, numbering prefixes) —
  Admin still needs to review/lock these before registration opens (Phase 3).
- Auth: password hashing (SHA-256 + per-user salt), opaque server-side sessions
  (SESSIONS sheet, 12h expiry), auth.login/auth.logout/auth.whoami actions. First
  real Admin account seeded. Session credential confirmed working as a body field,
  not a header, per the connectivity POC.
- Frontend: installable PWA shell (manifest, service worker caching the app shell
  only, never API calls), login screen, minimal per-role landing placeholder.
  Deployed to GitHub Pages at `https://gcbhoranj.github.io/ickpwa/`, tested end-to-end from a real
  device against the real backend.
- Explicitly NOT built yet (later phases): Admin user management UI, per-role
  dashboards, registration, coupons/QR, mess scanning, accommodation, refunds,
  document generation, reports. See spec §17 for the full phase order.
- Known follow-up for Phase 2 hardening: the `admin.bootstrap.*` actions are
  currently reachable by anyone who has the Web App URL. `setupSchema`/
  `seedSettings`/`setupDriveFolders` are idempotent and harmless to leave open;
  `seedFirstAdmin` self-locks once an admin exists. No change needed unless this
  assessment turns out wrong in practice.

### Bug fixed during Phase 1: Production login boolean/string coercion

During live deployment testing (Task 8), a production login bug was discovered: the admin account's `Active` flag in the USERS sheet silently flipped from a JS boolean to the string `"true"` after the first `updateRowById_` write to that row (Google Sheets coerces a raw boolean written into an already plain-text-formatted cell into its string form). This broke every login after the very first one. Root cause was found using a temporary, fully-removed diagnostic action (not guessed), and fixed with a minimal read-side `_isActiveFlag_` helper in `backend/Auth.gs` that accepts both boolean and string-"true" forms — no write-path changes. Verified against two consecutive real production logins. The same underlying Sheets behavior may affect other boolean-ish columns (e.g. `CONTINGENT_INCHARGES.Active`/`IsPrimary`) once later phases start writing them — noted for future attention, not fixed now since nothing reads them yet.
